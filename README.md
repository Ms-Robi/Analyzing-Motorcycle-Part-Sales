# Analyzing-Motorcycle-Part-Sales
This is a data analytics project for a company specializing in motorcycle parts. The business operates three warehouses that serve both retail and wholesale customers, offering multiple payment methods â€” each with unique transaction costs.

The goal of this project is to analyze sales performance and profitability by examining how wholesale revenue varies month-to-month and across warehouses, and to determine which payment methods yield the highest net revenue.
